## AccordiOS
A port of Accord from macOS to iOS.

This app is in a working state however there is still UI bugs and optimisations that need to be done.

### Notices
The UI needs an overhaul so it works and fits on the iPhone, currently its designed for the Mac.

I am currently storing the token in user default as I am having issues with getting the token to save in keychain, I hope this can be rectified soon.

A lot of code has either been modified or removed in order to get it working on iOS, I intend to slowly add the code that I have removed however in the meantime compare the code to [Accord](https://github.com/evelyneee/accord) to see what has been removed.

### Disclaimer
I am not responsible for anything that may happen to your Discord account while this app is in development.
